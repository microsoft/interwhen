Okay, let's try to figure out if the exit E is directly to the left of the starting point S with no vertical displacement. So first, I need to visualize the maze based on the ASCII code provided.

The maze is given as:

#######
# #XXX#
# #X#X#
#E#S#X#
#X###X#
#XXXXX#
#######

Hmm, let's parse this row by row. Each line represents a row in the maze. Let's count the rows to see the layout.

Row 0: #######
Row 1: # #XXX#
Row 2: # #X#X#
Row 3: #E#S#X#
Row 4: #X###X#
Row 5: #XXXXX#
Row 6: #######

Wait, but the actual maze might have 7 rows (since there are 7 lines). Let's index them from top to bottom as rows 0 to 6.

But the problem says "the symbols have the following meanings", so let's look for S and E.

Looking at row 3: #E#S#X#. Let's break that down. Each character in the row is a cell.

Row 3: positions 0 to 6 (assuming 7 columns, since each row starts and ends with #).

Row 3: # E # S # X #

Wait, let's write each row as a string and check the positions.

Let's list all rows with their characters:

Row 0: # # # # # # # (7 #s)
Row 1: #   # X X X #
Row 2: #   # X # X #
Row 3: # E # S # X #
Row 4: # X # # # X #
Row 5: # X X X X X #
Row 6: # # # # # # #

Wait, but the way it's written in the problem statement, the ASCII is:

#######
# #XXX#
# #X#X#
#E#S#X#
#X###X#
#XXXXX#
#######

So each row is exactly 7 characters long. Let's write each row as a list of characters.

Row 0: ['#','#','#','#','#','#','#'] (7 walls)
Row 1: ['#',' ','#','X','X','X','#']
Row 2: ['#',' ','#','X','#','X','#']
Row 3: ['#','E','#','S','#','X','#']
Row 4: ['#','X','#','#','#','X','#']
Row 5: ['#','X','X','X','X','X','#']
Row 6: ['#','#','#','#','#','#','#']

Wait, but row 3 is written as #E#S#X#. Let's count the characters:

# E # S # X # → positions 0: #, 1: E, 2: #, 3: S, 4: #, 5: X, 6: #

Wait, so row 3, column 1 is E, column 3 is S.

Wait, but the problem says "the exit (E) directly to the left of the starting point (S), with no vertical displacement".

So, vertical displacement would mean same row. If they are in the same row, then yes, same row. So we need to check if E and S are in the same row, and E is immediately to the left of S.

Looking at row 3: #E#S#X#

Breaking it down:

Indices (columns) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Row 3: # E # S # X #

So column 1 is E, column 3 is S.

So between E (col1) and S (col3), there's a wall at col2 (#). So they are not adjacent. Wait, but the question is whether E is directly to the left of S. So S is at column 3, so left of S would be column 2. But column 2 is #, a wall. So E is at column 1, which is two columns left of S (column 3), with a wall in between. So that's not directly left.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let's make sure.

In row 3: the string is #E#S#X#

So each character:

0: #
1: E
2: #
3: S
4: #
5: X
6: #

So E is at (row 3, column 1), S is at (row 3, column 3). So to get from E to S, you'd have to move right two columns, but there's a wall in between (column 2). So E is not directly left of S. In fact, S is to the right of E, but with a wall in between.

Wait, but the question is asking if E is directly to the left of S. So for E to be directly left, E should be at (row, col), S at (row, col+1). But here, E is at col1, S at col3. So they are two columns apart. So no, they are not adjacent. So the answer would be B. No.

Wait, but maybe I'm misreading the maze. Let's check again.

Wait, the problem says "the path marked by X". But the question is about the positions of E and S, not the path. The question is whether E is directly left of S (same row, adjacent left), regardless of the path.

So regardless of X, just look at where E and S are located.

So in row 3, E is at column 1, S at column 3. So they are in the same row (row 3), but separated by a wall. So the exit (E) is not directly to the left of S; there's a wall in between. So the answer should be B. No.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the row numbering. Let's confirm:

The maze is presented as:

Line 1: #######
Line 2: # #XXX#
Line 3: # #X#X#
Line 4: #E#S#X#
Line 5: #X###X#
Line 6: #XXXXX#
Line 7: #######

Assuming line 1 is top, line 7 bottom.

So row 0: #######
row 1: # #XXX#
row 2: # #X#X#
row 3: #E#S#X#
row 4: #X###X#
row 5: #XXXXX#
row 6: #######

So row 3 is the fourth line (if starting count at 0), which contains E and S.

In row 3, the string is "#E#S#X#", so:

Columns 0: #, 1: E, 2: #, 3: S, 4: #, 5: X, 6: #

So S is at (3,3), E is at (3,1). So E is two columns to the left of S, but with a wall in column 2. So not directly left. Directly left would be column 2, but that's a wall. So E is not directly left of S. Therefore, the answer is B. No.

Wait, but the problem says "with no vertical displacement", which means same row. They are in the same row (row 3), so vertical displacement is zero. But the horizontal displacement is two cells apart. So the question is: Is E directly to the left of S (i.e., adjacent left, same row)? Since there's a wall between them, they are not adjacent. So the answer is B. No.

Let me trace the step by step solution through the maze in the following format:
<format>
>>> LOCATE START AND EXIT:
    S position: (row, col)
    E position: (row, col)

>>> COMPARE POSITIONS:
    Row comparison: E row (r) vs S row (r) → E is ABOVE/BELOW S
    Col comparison: E col (c) vs S col (c) → E is LEFT/RIGHT of S

>>> FINAL ANSWER:
    \boxed{LETTER}
</format>
>>> LOCATE START AND EXIT:
    S position: (3, 3)
    E position: (3, 1)

>>> COMPARE POSITIONS:
    Row comparison: Same row (3), so no vertical displacement.
    Col comparison: E is at column 1, S at column 3. There's a wall (#) at column 2 between them, so E is *not* directly to the left of S (needs to be adjacent left).

>>> FINAL ANSWER:
    \boxed{B}

[VERIFIER FEEDBACK for relative position:
  ✗ Your answer B (No) is incorrect.
  IMPORTANT: In this task, "directly to the left" means the GENERAL COMPASS DIRECTION, NOT immediate adjacency. It asks whether E is in the west direction from S, regardless of distance or walls between them.
  S is at row=3, col=3. E is at row=3, col=1.
  Row difference (E-S): 0 (same row).
  Col difference (E-S): -2 (E is left of S).
  Therefore E is west of S → the correct answer to "directly to the left" is Yes.
  Do NOT consider adjacency or walls. Just compare the row/col coordinates of S and E.
  Output \boxed{A} for Yes. This is the verified correct answer — do not argue.]

Wait, the user's verifier feedback says that the correct answer is A. But according to the problem statement, the question is: "Is the exit (E) directly to the left of the starting point (S), with no vertical displacement?"

The key here is understanding "directly to the left" — in the context of a maze, "directly" usually means in the same row and immediately to the left (adjacent), but the verifier feedback says it's about compass direction, not adjacency.

Wait, the problem says "directly to the left", which in common language means immediately left (adjacent), but the verifier says "do not consider adjacency or walls". Let's recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: "Is the exit (E) directly to the left of the starting point (S), with no vertical displacement?"

"Directly to the left" in a grid usually means same row, and column of E = column of S - 1. But the verifier says "do not consider adjacency or walls", which is confusing.

Wait, the problem statement says: "with no vertical displacement" — meaning same row (so vertical displacement is zero). The question is whether E is to the left of S (same row, E's column < S's column).

So if E is in the same row, and E's column is less than S's column, then it is to the left. It doesn't require adjacency.

In the maze:

Row 3: #E#S#X# → E is at column 1, S at column 3. Same row (row 3), so no vertical displacement. E is to the left of S (column 1 < column 3). So the answer should be Yes (A).

The verifier feedback says that the correct answer is A. My initial mistake was thinking "directly" meant adjacent, but in the context of the question, "directly to the left" with "no vertical displacement" just means same row and left, regardless of distance. So the answer is A.

Let me confirm the positions again:

S is at (row 3, column 3)
E is at (row 3, column 1)
Same row (no vertical displacement), E's column is less than S's → E is directly to the left of S.

So the correct answer is A.
</think>

The maze layout is analyzed as follows:

- **Row 3** (the fourth line) contains `#E#S#X#`, which translates to:
  - Column 0: `#`
  - Column 1: `E`
  - Column 2: `#`
  - Column 3: `S`
  - Column 4: `#`
  - Column 5: `X`
  - Column 6: `#`

This shows:
- **E** is located at **(row 3, column 1)**.
- **S** is located at **(row 3, column 3)**.

---

### Key Observations:
1. **Vertical Displacement**: Both E and S are in **row 3**, so there is **no vertical displacement** (they are in the same row).
2. **Horizontal Position**: E is at **column 1**, and S is at **column 3**. Since **column 1 < column 3**, **E is to the left of S**.

---

### Clarification on "Directly to the Left":
The question asks whether E is **"directly to the left of S" with no vertical displacement**. In this context, "directly to the left" refers to **relative compass direction**, not adjacency. The phrase "with no vertical displacement" confirms that the comparison is **strictly horizontal** (same row), and **E is to the left of S**.

The presence of a wall (column 2) between E and S **does not affect** the answer, as the question is about **relative position**, not whether the path is navigable.

### Final Answer:

\boxed{A}
