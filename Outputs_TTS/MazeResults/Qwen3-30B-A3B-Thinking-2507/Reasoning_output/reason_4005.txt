Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the maze is given in ASCII, and I need to check if the exit E is directly to the left of the starting point S with no vertical displacement. That means they should be in the same row, and E is immediately to the left of S. Let me look at the maze.

First, I'll write down the maze as given:

#######
#  XXX#
###X#X#
# #X#X#
# #X#X#
#  E#S#
#######

Hmm, let's parse each line. Let's count the rows. Starting from the top:

Row 0: #######
Row 1: #  XXX#
Row 2: ###X#X#
Row 3: # #X#X#
Row 4: # #X#X#
Row 5: #  E#S#
Row 6: #######

Wait, but sometimes the rows might be numbered starting from 0 or 1. Let's check each row's content.

Let me list each row with their characters. Let's index columns as well. Let's assume each row is a string, and columns go from left to right.

Row 0: # # # # # # # (7 characters)
Row 1: #   X X X #
Row 2: # # # X # X #
Row 3: #   # X # X #
Row 4: #   # X # X #
Row 5: #   E # S #
Row 6: #######

Wait, maybe I should write each row out with their exact characters.

Original maze:

Line 1: ####### (7 #s)
Line 2: #  XXX#
Line 3: ###X#X#
Line 4: # #X#X#
Line 5: # #X#X#
Line 6: #  E#S#
Line 7: #######

Wait, the user wrote:

#######
#  XXX#
###X#X#
# #X#X#
# #X#X#
#  E#S#
#######

So that's 7 lines. Let's count:

Line 1: ####### (7 characters)
Line 2: #  XXX# (7 characters: #, space, space, X, X, X, #)
Line 3: ###X#X# (7 characters: #, #, #, X, #, X, #)
Line 4: # #X#X# (Wait, the user wrote "# #X#X#", which would be #, space, #, X, #, X, #? Wait, no, the actual string might have different spacing. Wait, the original problem's ASCII:

Here's the maze:

#######
#  XXX#
###X#X#
# #X#X#
# #X#X#
#  E#S#
#######

Wait, let's check each line's length. Each line should be 7 characters, since the first line is 7 #s.

Line 1: 7 #s.

Line 2: #  XXX# → positions 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: X, 4: X, 5: X, 6: # → 7 characters.

Line 3: ###X#X# → #, #, #, X, #, X, # → 7.

Line 4: # #X#X# → Hmm, maybe the user made a typo. Wait, original line is "# #X#X#", which would be #, space, #, X, #, X, #. Wait, but let's count: # (1), space (2), # (3), X (4), # (5), X (6), # (7). Wait, no, maybe the line is written as "# #X#X#" which would be 7 characters. Let's see: # followed by space, then #, X, #, X, #. So yes, 7.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote:

"# #X#X#" — so perhaps the third character is a space? Wait, no: the line is "# #X#X#", so characters are:

0: #, 1: space, 2: #, 3: X, 4: #, 5: X, 6: #. Wait, but that would be 7 characters. Hmm.

Similarly, line 5 is "# #X#X#" same as line 4.

Line 6: "#  E#S#" → characters: #, space, space, E, #, S, #.

Okay, now let's find where S and E are.

Looking for 'S' and 'E' in the maze.

In line 6 (the second last line, since line 0 is first), which is "#  E#S#".

Breaking it down:

Indices 0: #, 1: space, 2: space, 3: E, 4: #, 5: S, 6: #.

Wait, so position (row 5, column 3) is E, and (row 5, column 5) is S? Wait, rows and columns.

Wait, let's index rows starting from 0. So:

Row 0: ####### (top wall)
Row 1: #  XXX#
Row 2: ###X#X#
Row 3: # #X#X#
Row 4: # #X#X#
Row 5: #  E#S#
Row 6: ####### (bottom wall)

So row 5 is the line "#  E#S#".

In row 5, the characters are:

Column 0: #
Column 1: space
Column 2: space
Column 3: E
Column 4: #
Column 5: S
Column 6: #

So S is at (row 5, column 5), and E is at (row 5, column 3).

Wait, but the question is whether E is directly to the left of S with no vertical displacement. So same row, E's column is S's column minus 1.

S is at column 5, E at column 3. So the columns are 3 and 5. The difference is 2. So E is two columns to the left of S, not directly left. Also, between them is column 4 which is a # (wall), so they are not adjacent.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the exit (E) directly to the left of the starting point (S), with no vertical displacement". So same row, E is immediately left of S (so S is at (r,c), E at (r, c-1)).

But here, E is at column 3, S at column 5. So columns 3 and 5. So E is two steps left of S, but there's a wall in between (column 4 is #), so they are not adjacent. Therefore, E is not directly left of S.

Wait, but let's confirm the positions again.

Row 5: #  E#S#

Breaking it down:

Indices 0: #, 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: 'E', 4: '#', 5: 'S', 6: '#'

So S is at (5,5), E at (5,3). So E is two columns to the left of S. But between them at (5,4) is a wall. So they are not adjacent. Therefore, the exit E is not directly left of S. So the answer would be B. No.

Wait, but the problem says "with no vertical displacement", which just means same row. So vertical displacement would mean different rows. So same row, but left. But they are not adjacent. So the answer is B. No.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the row numbering. Let's check again.

Wait, the maze as given:

Line 1: ####### (row 0)
Line 2: #  XXX# (row 1)
Line 3: ###X#X# (row 2)
Line 4: # #X#X# (row 3)
Line 5: # #X#X# (row 4)
Line 6: #  E#S# (row 5)
Line 7: ####### (row 6)

So yes, row 5 is the one with E and S. So S is at (5,5), E at (5,3). So columns 3 and 5. So E is two left, but separated by a wall. So not directly left. Therefore, the answer is B. No.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the path marked by X". Wait, but the question is not about the path, just the positions of E and S. The question is a simple positional check. So regardless of the path, are E and S in the same row, with E immediately left of S.

Since they are two apart, answer is B. No.

Wait, but let me check again. Let's look at the maze as written:

The line with E and S is "#  E#S#". So after the two spaces, E, then #, then S. So the order is E followed by # followed by S. So E is at position 3, then a wall at 4, then S at 5. So S is to the right of the wall, E is to the left of the wall. So they are separated by a wall, not adjacent.

So the answer should be B. No.
</think>
Let me trace the step by step solution through the maze in the following format:
<format>
>>> LOCATE START AND EXIT:
    S position: (row, col)
    E position: (row, col)

>>> COMPARE POSITIONS:
    Row comparison: E row (r) vs S row (r) → E is ABOVE/BELOW S
    Col comparison: E col (c) vs S col (c) → E is LEFT/RIGHT of S

>>> FINAL ANSWER:
    \boxed{LETTER}
</format>
>>> LOCATE START AND EXIT:
    S position: (5,5)
    E position: (5,3)

>>> COMPARE POSITIONS:
    Row comparison: E row (5) vs S row (5) → same row (no vertical displacement)
    Col comparison: E col (3) vs S col (5) → E is 2 columns to the LEFT of S

>>> FINAL ANSWER:
    \boxed{B}

[VERIFIER FEEDBACK for relative position:
  ✗ Your answer B (No) is incorrect.
  IMPORTANT: In this task, "directly to the left" means the GENERAL COMPASS DIRECTION, NOT immediate adjacency. It asks whether E is in the west direction from S, regardless of distance or walls between them.
  S is at row=5, col=5. E is at row=5, col=3.
  Row difference (E-S): 0 (same row).
  Col difference (E-S): -2 (E is left of S).
  Therefore E is west of S → the correct answer to "directly to the left" is Yes.
  Do NOT consider adjacency or walls. Just compare the row/col coordinates of S and E.
  Output \boxed{A} for Yes. This is the verified correct answer — do not argue.]

Wait, the user's verifier feedback says that "directly to the left" means general compass direction, not adjacency. So even though they're not adjacent (there's a wall between them), the question is only asking about their relative positions (same row, E is to the left of S). So the answer should be A. Yes.

Let me re-read the question: "Is the exit (E) directly to the left of the starting point (S), with no vertical displacement?"

"Directly to the left" in terms of compass direction means same row, E's column < S's column. The question doesn't say "immediately to the left" or "adjacent". So even if there's a wall between them, if E is in the same row and to the left, the answer is Yes.

In the maze, E is at (5,3), S is at (5,5). Same row (row 5), E is to the left of S (3 < 5). So the answer is A. Yes.

The verifier feedback says that the correct answer is A. So I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning by considering adjacency, but the question does not require adjacency — just the relative compass direction.

So the correct answer is A.
</think>

To determine whether the exit **E** is *directly to the left* of the starting point **S** with *no vertical displacement*, we need to examine their **relative positions** in the maze, not their adjacency or the presence of walls between them.

---

### Step 1: Locate the positions of **S** and **E**

From the given ASCII maze:

```
#######
#  XXX#
###X#X#
# #X#X#
# #X#X#
#  E#S#
#######
```

We interpret each line as a row (starting from the top), and each character as a column (starting from the left). The maze has **7 rows** and **7 columns**.

Let’s identify the positions:

- **S** appears in the 6th row (index 5), at **column 5** → **(5, 5)**
- **E** appears in the 6th row (index 5), at **column 3** → **(5, 3)**

---

### Step 2: Analyze the relative positions

- **Row comparison**: Both **E** and **S** are in **row 5** → **no vertical displacement**
- **Column comparison**: **E** is at **column 3**, **S** is at **column 5** → **E is to the left of S**

The question asks:  
> *"Is the exit (E) directly to the left of the starting point (S), with no vertical displacement?"*

This is a **compass direction** question, not a **path adjacency** question. It does **not** require that **E** and **S** be adjacent, only that **E** lies **to the left** of **S** in the **same row**.

Since **E** is in the same row as **S** and **to the left**, the answer is **Yes**.
