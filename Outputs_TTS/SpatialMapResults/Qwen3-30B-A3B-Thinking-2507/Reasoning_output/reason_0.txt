Okay, let's try to figure out the direction of Planetarium Prints relative to Police Supply Store. So, the question is asking where Planetarium Prints is located compared to Police Supply Store. The options are Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, or Southeast.

First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me list out each statement one by one and see if I can map them out.

1. Police Supply Store is in the map. (So this is our reference point, maybe we can consider it as the origin point.)

2. Narwhal's Novelties is to the Northwest of Police Supply Store. So if Police Supply Store is at point P, then Narwhal's Novelties (N) is Northwest of P.

3. Coral Crafts is to the Northwest of Narwhal's Novelties. So Coral Crafts (C) is Northwest of N. But also, the next statement says Coral Crafts is to the Northwest of Police Supply Store. Wait, that seems conflicting? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the third sentence says: "Coral Crafts is to the Northwest of Narwhal's Novelties. Coral Crafts is to the Northwest of Police Supply Store." Hmm, so Coral Crafts is Northwest of both Narwhal's and Police Supply Store. Wait, but if Narwhal's is Northwest of Police, then Coral Crafts being Northwest of Narwhal's would place it further Northwest of Police. So that makes sense. So Police (P) -> Narwhal's (N) Northwest, then Coral (C) Northwest of N, so C is Northwest of P as well. So C is Northwest of P, which matches the second part of that sentence. So that's consistent.

4. Planetarium Prints (PP) is to the Southeast of Coral Crafts. So PP is Southeast of C. Also, Planetarium Prints is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store. So PP is Northeast of P. Wait, so PP is both Southeast of C and Northeast of P. Let's see if that fits.

5. Oz Oddities (O) is to the Southwest of Planetarium Prints. So O is Southwest of PP. Also, Oz Oddities is to the Southwest of Police Supply Store. So O is Southwest of P. Hmm, so O is Southwest of both PP and P. So PP must be Northeast of O, which would make sense if PP is Northeast of P, then O being Southwest of P would be Southwest of PP as well? Wait, maybe.

6. Ice Queen Ice Cream (I) is to the Northwest of Planetarium Prints. So I is Northwest of PP. Also, Ice Queen Ice Cream is to the Southeast of Coral Crafts. So I is Southeast of C.

Hmm. Let's try to sketch this mentally. Let's set Police Supply Store (P) at the center. Let's use compass directions.

Starting with P as the reference.

Narwhal's Novelties (N) is Northwest of P. So if P is at (0,0), N would be at (-1,1) assuming Northwest is up-left on a grid.

Coral Crafts (C) is Northwest of N, so further Northwest from N. So C would be at (-2,2). But also, Coral Crafts is Northwest of P, which matches because (-2,2) is Northwest of (0,0). So that's consistent.

Planetarium Prints (PP) is Southeast of Coral Crafts (C). So from C (-2,2), Southeast would be towards increasing x and decreasing y. So PP would be at (-1,1), but wait, that's where N is. Wait, maybe my coordinate system is off. Wait, maybe I should use a different coordinate system. Let's say North is up, East is right. So Northwest would be left and up. So if P is at (0,0), then Northwest would be negative x and positive y. Wait, maybe better to use standard coordinates where East is positive x, North is positive y. So:

- Northwest: left (negative x) and up (positive y)
- Northeast: right (positive x) and up (positive y)
- Southwest: left (negative x) and down (negative y)
- Southeast: right (positive x) and down (negative y)

Wait, but usually in maps, North is up, so:

- Northwest: up-left
- Northeast: up-right
- Southwest: down-left
- Southeast: down-right

So if we have a grid where the origin is Police Supply Store (P), then:

- Narwhal's Novelties (N) is Northwest of P, so N is at (-1, 1) assuming 1 unit NW.

- Coral Crafts (C) is Northwest of N, so from N (-1,1), moving NW would be (-2, 2). Also, Coral Crafts is Northwest of P, which (-2,2) is indeed Northwest of (0,0). So that's correct.

Now, Planetarium Prints (PP) is Southeast of Coral Crafts (C). Southeast from C (-2,2) would be moving towards positive x and negative y. So, for example, if we go 1 unit Southeast, it would be (-1,1), but wait, (-1,1) is where N is. Wait, maybe the distances are different. But the problem doesn't specify distances, just directions. So maybe PP is somewhere Southeast of C.

But also, Planetarium Prints is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store (P). Northeast of P (0,0) would be positive x and positive y. So PP must be in the Northeast quadrant relative to P.

Wait, so PP is Southeast of C, which is at (-2,2), and Northeast of P (0,0). Let's see. If C is at (-2,2), then Southeast from C would be towards increasing x (east) and decreasing y (south). So moving from C towards the southeast, we go towards (more positive x, less positive y). To reach a point that's Northeast of P (which is (0,0)), so PP must have x > 0 and y > 0 (assuming Northeast is up-right). Wait, but if C is at (-2,2), moving Southeast from C would take us towards (for example) (-1,1), (0,0), (1,-1), etc. But to be Northeast of P (0,0), PP must be in x>0, y>0. So from C (-2,2), moving Southeast (towards increasing x, decreasing y), we'd cross through (0,0) and beyond. Wait, but (0,0) is P. So if PP is Southeast of C, it's in the direction towards P and beyond. But PP is Northeast of P, so it should be on the other side of P from C. Hmm, maybe my coordinates are messed up.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's try to draw a rough sketch.

Let me place Police Supply Store (P) in the center.

Narwhal's Novelties (N) is Northwest of P. So N is up and to the left of P.

Coral Crafts (C) is Northwest of N, so further up and left from N. So C is Northwest of both N and P.

Planetarium Prints (PP) is Southeast of C. So from C, going Southeast (down and right), which would head towards P and beyond. But PP is also Northeast of P. So if you go Southeast from C, you end up Northeast of P. Let's see: If C is Northwest of P, then Southeast of C would be towards P and then further Southeast? Wait, no. If C is Northwest of P, then the direction from C to P is Southeast. So Southeast of C would be towards P and beyond. But PP is Southeast of C and also Northeast of P. So PP must be in the area that's Southeast of C but Northeast of P. So if P is the origin, C is at (-1,1), then Southeast from C would be towards (0,0) and then (1,-1), etc. But Northeast of P would be (positive x, positive y). Wait, that's conflicting. If PP is Southeast of C (which is Northwest of P), then PP should be in the direction towards P, but Northeast of P is a different direction. Hmm, maybe my coordinate system is confusing me.

Wait, let's use relative directions without coordinates. Let's imagine a compass.

- If Coral Crafts (C) is Northwest of Police (P), then to get from P to C, you go Northwest.

- Planetarium Prints (PP) is Southeast of C. So from C, go Southeast to get to PP.

- But PP is also Northeast of P. So from P, PP is Northeast.

So, if you go from P to C (Northwest), then from C to PP (Southeast), where does that end up relative to P?

Let's say P is the center. C is NW of P. From C, going SE would take you towards P and beyond. If PP is SE of C, then PP is in the direction towards P's SE. Wait, but PP is NE of P. Hmm, maybe the SE from C passes through P and ends up NE of P? Wait, no. If C is NW of P, then SE from C would be towards P's SE direction. Wait, maybe:

Imagine P is at the center. C is to the NW of P. So if you face P from C, you're facing SE. So moving SE from C gets you closer to P. If you go further SE beyond P, you'd be in the SE of P. But the problem says PP is Northeast of P. So that seems contradictory. Wait, but the problem states: "Planetarium Prints is to the Southeast of Coral Crafts. Planetarium Prints is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store."

So PP must be both Southeast of C and Northeast of P. Let's see if that's possible.

Let me think of it as a grid.

Let’s assign coordinates with P at (0,0).

C is Northwest of P, so C could be at (-1,1).

PP is Southeast of C (-1,1), so Southeast direction from C would be towards increasing x and decreasing y. So PP could be at (0,0) [which is P], but it's supposed to be a different location. So maybe (0, 0.5)? Wait, but (0,0.5) is Northeast of P (since x=0, y=0.5 is North, but Northeast would be x>0, y>0). Wait, (0,0.5) is North of P, not Northeast. To be Northeast, x and y both positive.

So if PP is Southeast of C (-1,1), moving Southeast would mean x increases and y decreases. To get to a point that's Northeast of P (x>0, y>0), we need x>0 and y>0. So starting from C (-1,1), moving Southeast (so x increases, y decreases), we need to end up at a point where x>0 and y>0. So y must decrease from 1 to something still positive, and x increases from -1 to something positive.

For example, if we go from C (-1,1) to (0.5, 0.5), that's Southeast (since x increased by 1.5, y decreased by 0.5). Then (0.5,0.5) is Northeast of P (0,0), since both x and y are positive. So that works. So PP would be Northeast of P.

Therefore, Planetarium Prints is Northeast of Police Supply Store. So the answer would be A. Northeast.

Wait, but let's check the other statements to make sure.

Oz Oddities (O) is Southwest of PP and Southwest of P.

So if PP is at (0.5, 0.5), then Southwest of PP would be towards negative x and negative y, so O would be at, say, (0,0), but P is at (0,0). Wait, O is Southwest of P as well. So Southwest of P (0,0) would be negative x and negative y, so O would be at (-0.5, -0.5), for example. Then, is O Southwest of PP (0.5, 0.5)? Yes, because (-0.5, -0.5) is Southwest of (0.5, 0.5). So that fits.

Ice Queen Ice Cream (I) is Northwest of PP and Southeast of C.

C is at (-1,1). Southeast of C would be towards increasing x and decreasing y. If PP is at (0.5, 0.5), then Northwest of PP would be decreasing x and increasing y. So I could be at (0,1), which is Northwest of PP (0.5,0.5), and Southeast of C (-1,1)? From C (-1,1), Southeast would be towards (0,0), so (0,1) is East of C, but Southeast would require moving down as well. Wait, (0,1) is East of C, not Southeast. Southeast from C (-1,1) would be, say, (0,0), which is directly Southeast. So if I is Southeast of C, then I should be somewhere like (0,0), but (0,0) is P. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, Southeast direction from C: to go Southeast, you go East and South. So from C (-1,1), moving East (x increases) and South (y decreases). So a point Southeast of C would have x > -1 and y < 1. Ice Queen is supposed to be Southeast of C, so that's correct. Also, Ice Queen is Northwest of PP. If PP is Northeast of P, say at (1,1), then Northwest of PP would be x < 1 and y > 1. Wait, maybe my coordinates are off.

Wait, let's try to reassign more carefully.

Let me set Police Supply Store (P) at (0,0).

Narwhal's Novelties (N) is Northwest of P, so N = (-1,1).

Coral Crafts (C) is Northwest of N, so C = (-2,2). Also, C is Northwest of P, which (-2,2) is indeed Northwest.

Planetarium Prints (PP) is Southeast of C, so from C (-2,2), Southeast would be towards increasing x and decreasing y. So PP could be at (-1,1), but that's N's location. Can't be. So maybe PP is at (0,1). Wait, from C (-2,2), moving Southeast: to get to (0,1), that's moving +2 in x and -1 in y, which is Southeast. Then PP at (0,1) is Northeast of P? (0,1) is North of P, not Northeast. Northeast would require positive x and y. So (0,1) is North, but not Northeast. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states PP is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store. So PP must be in the Northeast quadrant relative to P. So x > 0 and y > 0.

So let's say PP is at (1,1). Is (1,1) Southeast of C (-2,2)?

Southeast from C (-2,2) to (1,1): x increases by 3, y decreases by 1. Yes, that's Southeast direction. So that works. So PP at (1,1) is Southeast of C (-2,2) and Northeast of P (0,0). That fits.

Now, check Oz Oddities (O): Southwest of PP (1,1) and Southwest of P (0,0).

Southwest of PP (1,1) would be x <1, y <1. Southwest of P (0,0) would be x <0, y <0. So O should be in x <0, y <0. For example, (-1,-1). Then (-1,-1) is Southwest of both PP (1,1) and P (0,0). Yes, that works.

Ice Queen Ice Cream (I) is Northwest of PP (1,1) and Southeast of C (-2,2).

Northwest of PP (1,1) would be x <1, y >1. Southeast of C (-2,2) would be x >-2, y <2. So a point like (0,1.5) would be Northwest of PP (since x=0 <1, y=1.5 >1) and Southeast of C (-2,2) (x=0 >-2, y=1.5 <2). Yes, that works. So I at (0,1.5) fits both.

Okay, so with this coordinate system:

- P: (0,0)

- N: (-1,1)

- C: (-2,2)

- PP: (1,1)

- O: (-1,-1)

- I: (0,1.5)

This satisfies all the conditions.

Now, the question is: In which direction is Planetarium Prints relative to Police Supply Store?

PP is at (1,1), P is at (0,0). So from P, PP is to the Northeast. Because it's in the positive x and positive y direction. So the answer should be A. Northeast.

Wait, but let's confirm all statements again to be safe.

- Narwhal's is Northwest of Police: Yes, N (-1,1) is NW of P (0,0).

- Coral Crafts Northwest of Narwhal's: C (-2,2) is NW of N (-1,1). Yes, because x is more negative, y is higher.

- Coral Crafts Northwest of Police: Yes, C is NW of P.

- Planetarium Prints Southeast of Coral Crafts: PP (1,1) is Southeast of C (-2,2)? From C to PP: x increases by 3, y decreases by 1. Yes, that's Southeast direction.

- Planetarium Prints Northeast of Police: Yes, PP is NE of P.

- Oz Oddities Southwest of Planetarium Prints: O (-1,-1) is SW of PP (1,1). Yes.

- Oz Oddities Southwest of Police: O is SW of P (0,0). Yes.

- Ice Queen Northwest of Planetarium Prints: I (0,1.5) is NW of PP (1,1). Yes, x=0 <1, y=1.5 >1.

- Ice Queen Southeast of Coral Crafts: I (0,1.5) is Southeast of C (-2,2). x=0 > -2 (East), y=1.5 <2 (South), so yes, Southeast.

All conditions are satisfied with PP being Northeast of P. So the answer should be A. Northeast.

But wait, the problem lists the options as:

A. Northeast

B. Northwest

C. Southwest

D. Southeast

So A is the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check if I misread any of the statements. For example, the problem says "Planetarium Prints is to the Southeast of Coral Crafts. Planetarium Prints is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store." So directly states it's Northeast of Police, so why even ask? Wait, maybe it's a trick question, but according to the given info, it's explicitly stated. Wait, but the problem says "Please answer the following multiple-choice question based on the provided information." So even though it says "Planetarium Prints is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store," the question is asking for the direction, so the answer is A. But maybe I misread and it's a different statement.

Wait, let me check again the original problem:

"Planetarium Prints is to the Southeast of Coral Crafts. Planetarium Prints is to the Northeast of Police Supply Store."

Yes, it directly states that. So regardless of the other points, the answer should be Northeast. But maybe the problem is testing if we get confused with other directions. But according to the text, it's explicitly stated. So why all the other information? Maybe to confirm consistency, but the direct statement says it's Northeast. So answer A.

But in my coordinate system, that's correct. So the answer is A.
